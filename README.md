# Contact-Us-Form
This project is a simple and responsive "Contact Us" page built using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. The page includes input fields for the user's name, email, and message, with a clean and user-friendly layout. The form is designed to be easily customizable and can be integrated into any website that needs to collect contact information from users. Autocomplete is disabled for better privacy, and the structure is lightweight, making it easy to connect to a backend service like PHP, Node.js, or Firebase for form submission handling. The design is responsive and works well across modern browsers including Chrome, Firefox. Whether you're creating a personal portfolio, a company site, or a startup landing page, this contact form can serve as a useful starting point.
